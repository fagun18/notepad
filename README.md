# notepad
A personal notepad is a simple application that allows you to create and edit notes. Here's an example of a basic personal notepad application that you can use for personal use, this is built in python using Tkinter library:


This code uses the Tkinter library to create a simple graphical user interface for the notepad application. It creates a window with a text widget, which allows you to input and edit text, and two menu options: "Open" and "Save As".

The "Open" option allows you to open a text file, and the contents of the file will be displayed in the text widget. The "Save As" option allows you to save the contents of the text widget to a text file. The filedialog module is used to open and save files.

This is just a basic example, you can always customize and add more features to the notepad like adding more options in the menu, adding a toolbar, ability to format text or even adding a spell checker.

Please note that, this code uses the Tkinter library, which is the built-in GUI library for Python. If you don't have Tkinter installed, you can install it by running pip install tkinter in your terminal.
